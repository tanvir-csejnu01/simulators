# Operating Systems Simulators

This repository contains two academic simulators developed as part of my Operating Systems coursework. These simulators aim to provide an interactive and educational experience for understanding core concepts in operating systems, specifically CPU scheduling and classic synchronization problems.

## Project Overview

1. **CPU Scheduling Simulator**  
   This simulator demonstrates various CPU scheduling algorithms, allowing users to visualize how processes are scheduled for execution in a multitasking environment.

   **Features:**
   - Supports multiple algorithms, including:
     - First-Come-First-Served (FCFS)
     - Shortest Job Next (SJN)
     - Round Robin (RR)
     - Priority Scheduling
   - Customizable input for process arrival times, burst times, and priorities.
   - Visual representation of scheduling order and Gantt chart generation.

2. **Classic Synchronization Problems Simulator**  
   This simulator provides interactive demonstrations of solutions to classic synchronization problems, illustrating the implementation of synchronization mechanisms to avoid race conditions and ensure mutual exclusion.

   **Included Problems:**
   - Producer-Consumer Problem
   - Reader-Writer Problem
   - Dining Philosophers Problem
   - Sleeping Barber Problem

   **Features:**
   - Step-by-step visualization of problem execution.
   - Demonstration of synchronization primitives like semaphores, mutexes, and condition variables.
   - Adjustable parameters for thread behaviors and resource constraints.

## System Requirements

- **Java Version:** JDK 6 or higher (not compatible with versions below JDK 6).
- **Operating System:** Platform-independent (Windows, macOS, Linux) as long as Java is installed.
